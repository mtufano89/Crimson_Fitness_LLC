            <p>“I started training with Chris in 2017 with very little experience in the gym. 
                With his motivation, fitness has become a core part of my life. 
                Chris has an impressive technical background and has great attention to detail. He is thoughtful with the
                 programs he creates and tailors them to my unique goals, driving me to constantly improve and keeping me engaged.
                  My favorite thing about Chris is how he prioritizes good form — 
                  I am continuously learning so much from him!
